# Tennis-ball-game-for-VIP
In this project, a two players computer tennis game has been developed. Several speaker-arrays will be set and indicate a tennis ball sound; players are asked to reach the corresponding zone by identifying the sound is generated from which speakers. The camera will detect the playerâ€™s motion and determine if the player correct or not. Finally, the game will announce the scores of the players and the winner. To conclude, this project will provide a safe and easy-setting platform for VIP to do sports.
